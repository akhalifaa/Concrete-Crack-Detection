# Concrete-Crack-Detection

## Project Overview:
* Downloaded a large [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection) of cracked and non-cracked concrete images from Kaggle and trained a model to detect such cracks on a test set of similar concrete specimens.
* Created a four layer convoluted neural network model with ReLU activation and maxpooling in between layers and a sigmoid activation for calssification. I implemented the model with a (3,3) kernel size and a (2,2) pooling size.
* Observed some metrics for the model after trainin git and looked at the accuracy, training loss and the cofusion matrix after testing the model on the testing set.
